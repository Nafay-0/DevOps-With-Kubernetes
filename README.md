### Exercise 3.9 DBaaS vs DIY
- **Solution Submission**: [3.9](https://github.com/Nafay-0/DevOps-With-Kubernetes/tree/3.9)

#### Overview: DBaaS compared to a Self-Managed Database on Kubernetes

The table below contrasts using a managed database service (DBaaS) with running your own database inside Kubernetes using StatefulSets and PersistentVolumeClaims.

| Category | Managed Database (DBaaS, e.g. Cloud SQL) | Self-Managed (StatefulSet + PVC) |
|--------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Setup Effort** | Very fast — provisioning is mostly automated | Higher — requires configuring storage, networking, and secrets |
| **Pricing Model** | More expensive due to management overhead | Typically cheaper, paying mainly for cluster resources |
| **Operational Work** | Low — upgrades and patches handled by provider | High — updates and security are your responsibility |
| **Scalability** | Straightforward — scaling via provider settings | Manual — scaling requires Kubernetes and database knowledge |
| **Backup Strategy** | Built-in backups and point-in-time recovery | Must be implemented manually (e.g., CronJobs, Velero) |
| **Availability** | Provided out of the box with automatic failover | Difficult — replication and failover must be designed |
| **Disaster Recovery** | Often included with regional or cross-region options | Needs custom backup and restore solutions |
| **Configuration Control** | Restricted to exposed settings | Full access to all database configuration options |
| **Portability** | Tightly coupled to the cloud provider | Portable across different Kubernetes environments |
| **Skill Requirements** | Lower — infrastructure details are abstracted away | Higher — requires solid Kubernetes and storage knowledge |
| **Observability** | Integrated monitoring and alerting | Requires external tooling like Prometheus and Grafana |
| **Security Setup** | TLS and encryption usually preconfigured | Certificates and encryption must be set up manually |

#### Suitable Use Cases for DBaaS
- Production systems with strict uptime requirements  
- Small teams lacking database administration expertise  
- Projects with tight delivery timelines  
- Environments with compliance or auditing needs  

#### Suitable Use Cases for Self-Managed Databases
- Development or non-critical workloads  
- Projects aiming to minimize costs  
- Scenarios requiring fine-grained database tuning  
- Hybrid or multi-cloud deployments  
- Educational setups to learn Kubernetes internals
